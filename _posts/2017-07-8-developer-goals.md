title: Developer Goals
---

My goals as a front-end developer are to be able to understand how to build and style websites, to be able to make lives easier/entertaining for others, work in a team on innovative projects, and land a job as a developer in San Francisco.

Although becoming a front-end developer is not my main goal for joining BLOC's Software Developer program, it is something I've been curious about. I tend to spend most of my free time browsing the internet. For the longest time, I've been wondering how hard it is to create websites and make better versions of existing websites. For example, as much as I love korean dramas, I have not found a website that gives me the viewing experience that I want. If I didn't find one that I like, that must be the case for other people too. I wish to have the knowledge to be able to create something that others can benefit from.

Times has changed and so will people. We live in an era where technology is on the rise and eventually, the majority of people will adapt to it. My goal is to be able to create websites/apps that people will be happy using. Living in San Francisco, there is not a single day that I don't see people being obsessed with their smart phones and tech gadgets(even me). At this rate, being a developer will be useful and wanted. 

One author that inspired me to start taking interest in coding was MJ DeMarco. Ever since reading his book "The Millionaire's Fastlane" where he talked about how he got started with his coding career, I was hooked on the idea of coding to make the world an easier, more fun place. If I remember correctly, he set life in motion once he gave his all solely to coding and investing in himself. He became someone who started from almost nothing to having wealth and happiness. If he can do it, so can I.

Now is a good time( if not the best) to start thinking up innovative ideas and bringing them to life. With so many coding bootcamps out there and many people showing interest in coding, I think now is a really good time to work with other enthusiastic coders to create innovative programs/websites/apps. Before, not as much people were interested in coding so it'd be hard to find someone to work with. In the future, coming up with ideas might be difficult as there will be a lot out there. I would like to work on making programs similar to Uber, Yelp, AirBnB, and Amazon. 

After living in San Francisco for my whole life, it shaped my goals as a devewloper. Maybe living in San Francisco really pushed me forward to becoming a developer. I'm surrounded by tech companies and friends who work in them. After visiting their offices, I strived to want to be in their positions. I want to be able to live in an expensive city with my childhood friends and family. In order for that to happen, my best option is to land a job as a developer in the city.
