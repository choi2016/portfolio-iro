title: Biggest Challenge As a Developer
---

While studying to become a developer, many challenges have appeared and will keep appearing. Some of the challenges include not knowing nearly enough about the material, how to think like a developer, not being efficient enough, and finding my reason for becoming a developer. 

By far the biggest challenge I've faced is not knowing enough about what I'm learning. While I do know the concept, I sometimes forget the little details that matter. Given the time-frame of when I'm learning through BLOC, I can only learn so much. In order to tackle this challenge, I do lots of reviewing and looking up other similar resources. I also tackle them by continuously coding on a daily basis. The more I practice, the more I'll understand and know. I feel like this challenge is absolutely necessary for every developer. My mentor told me if I can't explain a concept fully, then I don't fully know the concept. Because of what my mentor told me, I always strive to know everything, which in the long run would be better for me becoming a developer.

Another important challenge that comes up is how to tackle a problem like a developer. Since it hasn't been that long since I've seriously started coding, I don't have the coders mentality. I'm so used to doing things my way, which does not work when trying to become a developer. In my opinion, I believe developers should think and be efficient. I'm tackling this challenge by studying as much as I can so that I have more knowledge and practicing daily. With more knowledge, I should know how to use that knowledge. 

I sometimes ask myself why I'm coding in the first place. If I don't have a goal in mind, I can't focus well enough to study. Although I had goals before joining BLOC, eventually those goals change. I tackle this problem by asking myself frequently what I'm aiming for. Once I ask myself that, I become more enthusiastic to study.
