title: Bloc experience

After being in the program for a little over a month, my overall experience with BLOC has been good. I owe that to my mentor who helps direct me in the right direction so that I can become a better developer. In terms of the material, I have mixed feelings so far. As much as I've learned(compared to what I learned in school), I learned way more than I thought I could've on my own. People get the misconception that coding bootcamps should be cheaper because most of the material is already available online. I think it's well worth the money to have all the material at my fingertips rather than having to spend time looking for it. 

Having a mentor has got to be the best part of the program. Not only does Kevin answer my questions, he answers them in a way that I'll eventually become a better developer. He does not give me straight up answers but rather tell me how to get that answer(which I like). He also provides quality feedback to my messages. I know that I can put my trust in him as he is an intelligent individual. During our online meetings twice a week, I like how he's on top of things. He asks me how I'm doing and tells me what I should be doing. I'm really grateful that I chose him as my mentor.

I absolutely love how easy it is to view the materials on BLOC. Before when I tried to code on my own, I would spend hours trying to find what I'm looking for while on BLOC, it only takes me a couple of minutes. Having a mentor also helps with this process if it's taking too much time. BLOC is set up in a way that students learn the basics first, then they move on. I really like this as it shows me what I need to know before going further. Without a coding bootcamp, I would most likely be lost on what to learn and when.
